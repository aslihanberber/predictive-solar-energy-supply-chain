# predictive-solar-energy-supply-chain
The multidisciplinary graduation project addresses the critical issue of optimizing renewable energy supply chains with the power of advanced machine learning techniques and logistics system planning, specifically focusing on the integration of solar energy into existing energy distribution infrastructures. It confronts significant challenges such as the increasing costs and logistical complexities in renewable energy sectors, as well as the unpredictability and remoteness of renewable sources. 

In tackling these challenges, the project initially employs a sophisticated machine learning-based approach for precise energy demand forecasting, using models like ETS, ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost. This approach considers variables including cumulative demand, the interplay between grid and solar energy, and user behavior influenced by Time-of-Use pricing.

An ensemble of ETS and LSTM provided superior forecasting accuracy, while a Gurobi-based linear programming model optimized solar energy distribution, balancing production, grid costs, and consumer demands, ensuring equitable energy access, efficient load management, and minimized grid energy costs. The project demonstrates the significant potential of machine learning to enhance the efficiency and scalability of solar energy distribution.
